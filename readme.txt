Weapons:
AK-47
	This assault rifle will eliminate the enemy in 3 shots. Having a lower damage compared to the M4, the AK-47 will make it for it by having double the magazine size.
AWP
	This sniper rifle is the only gun in the game that kills every enemy with one shot. However, it is very slow to shoot, taking more than a second to shoot the next bullet.
M4A1-S
	This silenced rifle will kill an enemy in two shots, but has a limited magazine capacity.
MAG-7
	The MAG-7 is a shotgun that deals a moderate amount of damage. It has a much higher spread than the other guns 
	
	
Items:
Max Ammo
	Fills up the magazine with ammo. If reloading, it resets the reload timer and the player can shoot again.
Weapon
	Replaces the current player's gun. If the player picks up the same gun, the ammo is refilled like Max Ammo, but will not reset the reload timer.
Max Health
	Heals 50% of the player's health.
Invulnerability
	Player is invulnerable for 5 seconds.
Nuke
	Destroys everything on the field, and also damages 75% of the player's current health. 
	PROTIP: Using Nuke while invulnerable will not damage the player!
